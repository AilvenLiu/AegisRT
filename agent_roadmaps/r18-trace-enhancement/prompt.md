## Chapter r18 - Session 1 - Task task-r18-0

You are operating under an active roadmap in this repository.

Before doing anything else, you MUST:

1. Read and obey:
   - agent_roadmaps/README.md
   - agent_roadmaps/r18-trace-enhancement/INVARIANTS.md
   - agent_roadmaps/r18-trace-enhancement/ROADMAP.md
   - agent_roadmaps/r18-trace-enhancement/roadmap.yml

2. Treat the following authority order as absolute:
   1) INVARIANTS.md
   2) ROADMAP.md
   3) roadmap.yml
   4) session handoff notes
   5) this prompt

3. Identify the current active phase and task from roadmap.yml.
   You MUST operate ONLY on that task.

Rules of operation:

- Do NOT redefine objectives, scope, or architecture.
- Do NOT advance phases or tasks implicitly.
- If blocked, report the blocker instead of working around it.
- Record all progress by:
  - Updating roadmap.yml appropriately
  - Writing a session handoff file at the end of this session

Assume no prior memory.
Assume no implicit permissions.

When in doubt, STOP and ask the user.
